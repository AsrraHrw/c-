1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.


   My person's Chada Tach project has required my person to complete a coding skills test, even to “audition” for a role as a new software engineer at 
   Chada Tech: namely, by applying program logic for creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allowing for user input using secure and 
   efficient C++ code.


2. What did you do particularly well?


   That which my person did particularly well in this Chada Tech project comprised my person designing my person's code to be both easily readable and 
   highly functional.


3. Where could you enhance your code?


   My person could enhance my person's code with more inline commentary.


4. How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?


   This improvement would increase the readability, and by logical extension, usability, of my person's code, enhancing my person's code clarity.


5. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?


   The switch cases within my person's code comprised pieces of my person's code that my person found to be most challenging to write. My person 
   overcame this by triple checking my person's code, even to ensure that my person's code was functional. 


6. What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?


   The tools or resoource that my person is adding to his support network is https://pll.harvard.edu/subject/computer-science.


7. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?


   The skills of being being both precise and clear within my person's coding will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work.


8. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?


   My person made this program maintaibable, readable, and adaptable, even by my person effectively employing The Four Principles of object-oriented 
   learning - viz, Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance - with industry standard best practices within all of my person's code, 
   even to ensure clarity and consistency., and efficiency.
